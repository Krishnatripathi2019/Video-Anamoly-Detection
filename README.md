# CCTV_Fall_Detector

Real-time Fall Detection and Gait Analysis of a Person unobtrusively using CCTV footage

### Motivation

**Gait analysis** is a method for identifying biomechanical abnormalities in the gait cycle, i.e.  **the way a person walks.**<br/>
**Abnormal gait**, if gone undetected can be aggrevated by injury and lead to major musculoskeletal and cardiovascular problems.<br/> 
Automated Fall detection and gait analysis is crucial in alerting emergency in a number of situations:<br/>
* For a person walking alone in an isolated hallway/street
* Track progress in rehabilitation of individuals having serious musculoskeletal injuries.
* Gait correction for individuals

Popular sensor-based fall detection methods are obtrusive and inconvenient for individuals to wear continuously 

### Objective
* To extract critical gait features from the human silhouette obtained using unobtrusive off-the shelf CCTV infrastructure.
* To trigger an alert system in response to emergency condition such as fainting  to provide medical assistance within the “Golden Hour”
* To perform analysis on gait cycles to infer additional gait and human characteristics
